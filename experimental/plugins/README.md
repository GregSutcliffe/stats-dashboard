# Plugins

https://stats.theforeman.org/apps/plugins/

A rough attempt to track plugin evolution over time. Based on Apache httpd
download logs, so take these numbers with a *lot* of salt, as they will be
subject to bias from mirroring, sandboxes, testing environments, etc.

The logs are filtered to *one* line per unique IP/package/date combination, so
multiple downloads per day of the same package by the same IP will not by
recorded. As such this is (very roughly) a graph of unique IPs downloading a
plugin, per day
